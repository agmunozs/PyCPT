## How to cite
We recommend this citation for PyCPT:

> Muñoz, Á.G., Robertson, A.W., Turkington, T., Mason, S.J., and contributors, 2019: "PyCPT: a Python interface and enhancement for IRI's Climate Predictability Tool". [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/142679292.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/142679292)

Since PyCPT is interfacing with CPT, you should also cite CPT itself. For example, the citation for version 16.2.3 is:
> Mason, S.J., Tippet, M., Song, L., Muñoz, Á.G., 2019: "Climate Predictability Tool version 16.2.3". DOI: https://doi.org/10.7916/d8-19cq-rn26

Please find [here](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&sort=Published+Latest&search_field=all_fields&q=%22Climate+Predictability+Tool%22) the exact citation to the CPT version desire to cite; note that the DOI varies in each version.
